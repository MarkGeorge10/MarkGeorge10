<h4>Machine Learning Projects</h4>

- **AI-Driven News Intelligence Platform**
  <br/>Used technology: Python, NLP analsis, HPC super computer, NTLK, SCapy<br/>
      This project delivers an automated news aggregation and curation system, combining web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and user feedback mechanisms to streamline information consumption. The platform integrates two primary data       
       pipelines: (1) a third-party integration with Inoreader API, where a Python-based scraper collects and processes news articles before marking them as read, and (2) a user-configurable RSS feed management system. Users can dynamically add or 
       remove RSS feeds via a Next.js dashboard, with all feed metadata stored in PostgreSQL. The scraper service automatically discovers and processes new content from these feeds, ensuring continuous data ingestion.

  At the core of the platform is an NLP-powered classification engine that filters articles into "Important" or "Not Important" categories. Built using BERT-based models and fine-tuned with user feedback, the system continuously improves its 
       accuracy through iterative retraining. Additionally, the platform incorporates advanced text summarization techniques (e.g., PEGASUS-X) to generate concise, executive-style summaries of each article, complete with keyword extraction and source 
     attribution. These summaries are presented alongside the original content, enabling users to quickly grasp key insights without sifting through lengthy articles.

     The system is designed for scalability and user-centricity. A Next.js dashboard provides an intuitive interface for managing feeds, viewing summaries, and providing feedback on article relevance. Backend services, built with FastAPI and deployed 
     on AWS, ensure high performance and reliability, while Docker containerization simplifies maintenance and scaling. By combining cutting-edge NLP techniques with robust engineering practices, this platform empowers users to stay informed 
     efficiently, reducing information overload while maintaining context and accuracy.

The role of the project was to distinguish ways to have casual riders buy a membership using digital media to increase the company‚Äôs profit by converting casual riders to annual members. 

- **[Heart Attack Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/code/theoryers/heart-diseases-prediction-system)**
   <br/>Used technology:Python, Excel, Kaggle, Spider, Preprocessing, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep learning<br/>
  This project was a predictable model by Random Forest Decision Trees library with accuracy of 84%. My prediction system was updated by using ANN with accuracy of 94%, to evaluate the risk of every patient who probably has heart disease.


<h4>Backend Projects</h4>

  - **Building News Intelligence Backend with FastAPI and PostgreSQL**
    <br/>Used technology: Python, FASTAPI, Prisma, Github, Git, Supabase, Docker <br/>
    The AI-powered news platform‚Äôs backend was built using FastAPI, a high-performance Python framework, to handle API requests, manage data pipelines, and integrate AI models. Its asynchronous capabilities efficiently processed tasks like article          scraping, NLP processing, and content delivery, while RESTful endpoints ensured seamless communication between components. PostgreSQL was chosen for data storage, optimized for structured data like article metadata, RSS feeds, and NLP outputs. The 
    pgvector extension enabled semantic search, and Redis caching improved performance. Docker ensured consistent deployment, and AWS provided scalable infrastructure. Together, FastAPI and PostgreSQL formed a robust, scalable foundation supporting 
    real-time data ingestion, NLP, and user feedback, with room for future enhancements like multi-language support and advanced analytics.
